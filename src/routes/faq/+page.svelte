            question: "What types of artworks can I purchase?",
            answer: "Our lunar gallery offers a diverse range of digital and physical art forms: digital originals, limited editions, AI-generated works, quantum-encrypted NFTs, holographic installations, 3D-printed sculptures, time-dilated exhibitions, and space-synchronized installations. All pieces are transmitted directly from our lunar orbital station.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "How does the artist revenue sharing work?",
            answer: "Our innovative revenue model allocates funds as follows: 75% goes directly to the artist, 10% enters our Universal Artist Pool (distributed monthly among all participating artists based on engagement metrics), and 15% supports our lunar infrastructure maintenance, quantum transmission networks, and platform development.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "How are artists selected for the gallery?",
            answer: "Artists are selected through a combination of our AI curator algorithm and human panel review. We look for creators who push the boundaries of digital-physical art fusion and space-time manipulation. Applications are reviewed quarterly during the lunar perigee.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "How does shipping work for physical pieces?",
            answer: "Physical artworks (prints, 3D sculptures) are manufactured at our Earth-based facilities using quantum-transmitted specifications. Shipping costs vary by location and are calculated at checkout. Original works are arranged directly with the artist after purchase confirmation.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "What about digital delivery?",
            answer: "Digital works are transmitted instantly through our quantum-encrypted channels. NFTs are minted on our lunar blockchain, and holographic installations require our proprietary viewer (provided free with purchase).",
            isOpen: false
        }
    ];

    let technicalFaqs = [
        {
            question: "Do you offer authenticity certificates?",
            answer: "All works come with a quantum-encrypted certificate of authenticity, timestamped using lunar orbital parameters. NFTs are verified through our proprietary space-time blockchain.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "What happens if there's a transmission error?",
            answer: "Our quantum entanglement network ensures 99.99% transmission accuracy. In rare cases of solar interference, our backup systems will automatically retransmit within one lunar cycle.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "Can I resell my purchased artworks?",
            answer: "Yes, our lunar marketplace supports secondary sales. Digital works include smart contracts that ensure artist royalties (5%) on all future transactions. Physical pieces can be resold with original quantum certificates.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "How do you handle returns?",
            answer: "Digital works are non-refundable once transmitted. Physical pieces can be returned within one lunar cycle (27.3 Earth days) if they don't match their quantum signature specifications.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer lunar-cycle payment plans (27.3 days) for purchases over 1,000â‚¬. We accept major Earth currencies, cryptocurrencies, and space mining credits.",
            isOpen: false
